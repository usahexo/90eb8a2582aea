#  How to Get the Most out of the Tree of Fortune Game

The Tree of Fortune game is a great way to pass the time and has plenty of rewards to offer players. In order to make the most of the game, it is important to understand how it works and what strategies can be used.

The basic premise of the game is to collect as many rewards as possible from the tree. Rewards can be obtained by swiping in any direction and include coins, gems, and power-ups. The aim is to get as far up the tree as possible before running out of moves.

There are a few tips that can help players get further up the tree and maximise their rewards. Firstly, it is important to use power-ups wisely. Some power-ups are more useful than others so make sure to use them at the right time. The ‘Hammer’ power-up can be used to break tiles that are blocking the way, while the ‘Shield’ power-up can be used to protect tiles from being destroyed.

Secondly, focus on collecting coins and gems rather than using moves on trying to get higher up the tree. Coins and gems can be used to purchase power-ups, so it is important to stock up on these whenever possible.

Lastly, always keep an eye on the bonus bar at the top of the screen. This bar fills up over time and once full will award players with a bonus reward. The bonus reward can be anything from coins to gems to power-ups so it is worth trying to fill up the bar as much as possible.
