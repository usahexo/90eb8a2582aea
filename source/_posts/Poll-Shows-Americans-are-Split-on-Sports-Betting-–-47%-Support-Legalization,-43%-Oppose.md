#  Poll Shows Americans are Split on Sports Betting – 47% Support Legalization, 43% Oppose

A new poll by the Chicago-based research firm, Market Shares Corporation, shows that there is divided opinion on the legalization of sports betting in the United States. The poll results indicate that 47% of Americans support legalizing sports betting, while 43% oppose it.

The issue of legalizing sports betting has been a topic of debate in the United States for many years. In May 2018, the US Supreme Court overturned a law that had prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting. Since then, several states have moved to legalize sports betting, including New Jersey, Delaware, Mississippi, and West Virginia.

Opponents of legalizing sports betting argue that it could lead to increased incidents of gambling addiction and corruption in professional sports. Supporters argue that legalization would help to regulate the industry and bring in new tax revenue for states.

The Market Shares Corporation poll surveyed 1,000 adults nationwide between July 9 and 15.

#  NY Times Editorial Board Calls for Legalization of Sports Betting

In a recent editorial, the New York Times editorial board called for the legalization of sports betting in the United States. The board believes that such a move would generate billions of dollars in tax revenue and help to curtail illegal gambling.

Currently, sports betting is only legal in a handful of states. And while most Americans believe that it should be legalized, there is significant opposition from professional sports leagues and other groups who worry about the potential for corruption.

Supporters of legalizing sports betting argue that it is already happening illegally and that regulation would provide more oversight and ensure that taxes are paid. They also point out that it would create new jobs and stimulate the economy.

Opponents of legalization argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and contribute to organized crime. They also say that it could damage the integrity of sporting contests.

The issue is sure to be debated in Congress and in state legislatures across the country in the coming months and years.

#  How Sports Betting Can Help States and Local Communities

Sports betting has been a hot topic in the United States in recent years. The Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on sports betting in May 2018, and since then, several states have legalized it.

Proponents of sports betting argue that it can help states and local communities by generating revenue from taxes and fees. They also argue that it can create jobs and boost the economy.

Opponents of sports betting argue that it can lead to addiction and gambling problems. They also argue that it can hurt the integrity of sporting events.

So, what is the truth?

The evidence suggests that sports betting can be beneficial for states and local communities. A study by Oxford Economics found that legalizing sports betting could generate $6.5 billion in economic output and more than 71,000 jobs nationwide. In addition, a study by the National Hockey League found that legal sports betting could generate up to $425 million in annual gaming revenue across the country.

The benefits of sports betting are not limited to large states or urban areas. A study by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas found that legalizing sports betting could generate an additional $1 million per year for rural counties in Nevada. This would be a welcome boost for these counties, which often have higher unemployment rates and lower incomes than urban areas.

The bottom line is that sports betting can be a valuable source of revenue for states and local communities. It can create jobs and boost the economy. And while there are some risks associated with sports betting, they appear to be manageable.

#  Delaware Seeks to be the Next State to Legalize Sports Betting

The state of Delaware is the latest to seek to legalize sports betting in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in May to overturn a federal law that had prohibited most states from authorizing sports gambling.

Gov. John Carney Jr. announced on Tuesday that he planned to introduce a bill that would allow bets on professional and college sports, starting with NFL games in September.

“We want to be sure that we have all of our ducks in a row, but I think there is a good chance that we could get something passed this year,” Mr. Carney said at a news conference.

Delaware was one of four states — along with Nevada, Montana and Oregon — that were exempted from the federal prohibition because they had previously legalized some form of sports gambling. In 2011, Delaware became the first state to allow parlay betting on NFL games.

But other states have been seeking to take advantage of the Supreme Court ruling by legalizing various forms of sports betting. In New Jersey, which led the challenge against the federal ban, lawmakers are pushing for a bill that would allow bets on all professional and college sports, as well as horseracing. More than a dozen other states are also considering similar measures.

Opposition to sports betting has been waning in recent years as more and more states have moved to legalize it. The American Gaming Association, which represents the casino industry, has come out in favor of legalizing sports betting, arguing that it would generate billions of dollars in new revenue for state and local governments.

Some lawmakers and officials are concerned about the potential for match-fixing or other corruption in light of legalized sports betting. But others argue that such concerns can be addressed through regulation and enforcement.

#  Petition Started to Legalize Sports Betting in California

A petition has been started in California to legalize sports betting. The petition is seeking to get enough signatures to have the issue put on the ballot in the upcoming election.

Supporters of the measure argue that legalized sports betting would bring in much-needed revenue to the state. They also argue that it would create jobs and help tourism.

Opponents of the measure argue that it would lead to increased crime and addiction problems. They also argue that it would be harmful to the integrity of sporting events.

If the measure were to be approved by voters, it would make California the third state in the nation to legalize sports betting. Nevada and Delaware are currently the only states where sports betting is legal.
