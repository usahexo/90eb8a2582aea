#  How To Apply Blackjack Rubber Roofing Major Coat Like A Pro 

When it comes to roofing, there are a variety of materials to choose from, with different advantages and disadvantages. One popular choice for roofing is rubber roofing. Rubber roofing is typically made of recycled materials, so it’s environmentally friendly. It’s also resistant to weather damage, making it a good choice for climates that experience a lot of rain or snow.

If you’re considering rubber roofing for your home, be sure to read up on the installation process before you get started. Installing rubber roofing can be a bit tricky, but with the right tools and instructions, you can do it yourself. In this article, we’ll walk you through the steps of applying a blackjack rubber roofing major coat like a pro.

The first step is to clean the surface of the roof. This will ensure that the adhesive will stick properly. Use a wire brush to scrub off any dirt or debris from the surface of the roof.

 Next, cut the rubber sheet to fit the size of your roof. You may need to use scissors or a utility knife to cut it to size. Be sure to leave an extra inch or two around all edges so that you have enough material to work with.

Once the sheet is cut to size, apply adhesive to the surface of the roof. Be sure to spread it evenly across the entire surface. Then place the rubber sheet on top of the adhesive and press down firmly so that it sticks in place.

Now it’s time to seal the seams. Use a caulking gun to apply silicone sealant around all of the edges where the sheets meet each other. This will create a watertight seal that will keep moisture out and protect your roof from damage. Let the sealant dry for 24 hours before moving on to the next step.

The final step is to install flashing tape over all of the seams on the edge of your roof. This will further waterproof your roof and prevent water from leaking through any cracks or openings in the membrane. Let the flashing tape dry for 24 hours before using your roof again.

That’s all there is to it! By following these simple steps, you can apply blackjack rubber roofing like a pro and keep your home safe and weatherproof for years to come
