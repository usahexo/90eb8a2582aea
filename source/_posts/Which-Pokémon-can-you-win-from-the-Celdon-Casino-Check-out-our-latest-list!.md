#  Which Pokémon can you win from the Celdon Casino? Check out our latest list!

Pokémon enthusiasts rejoice! The Celdon Casino has just released a list of all the Pokémon that can be won from their casino. So which one will you snag first? Check out our latest list to find out!

Pikachu

A fan favorite, Pikachu is always a top choice for any Pokémon trainer. This electric-type Pokémon is known for being quick and powerful, making it a great contender in any battle. In the Celdon Casino, Pikachu can be won in the racing game table.

Eevee

Another well-loved Pokémon, Eevee is a versatile creature that can evolve into several different kinds of Pokémon depending on how it’s treated. In the casino, it can be found in the slot machines as well as in other games of chance. Who knows – maybe Eevee will evolve into a powerful Vaporeon or Jolteon after being caught in the casino!

Magikarp

Poor Magikarp – this fish is often laughed at because of its weak stats. However, with enough training Magikarp can become an incredibly powerful Gyarados. In the Celdon Casino, it can be found in the fishing game table. Go ahead and give this lowly Pokémon a chance – you may be surprised at what it can do!

#  Can you guess which Pokémon is the rarest in the Celdon Casino?

There's a lot of discussion and debate over which Pokémon is the rarest in the Celdon Casino. The answer, however, is not as clear-cut as one might think.

When it comes to rarity, there are a few different factors that need to be considered. These include how often the Pokémon can be found in the wild, its overall power and how difficult it is to capture.

Taking all of this into account, there are a few contenders for the rarest Pokémon in the casino. Mewtwo and Tyranitar are perhaps the two most powerful Pokémon in the game, and they're both quite difficult to catch. Lugia is also a strong contender, given its impressive stats and limited appearances in the wild.

There are others who could also be considered rare, such as Machamp, Dragonite and Blastoise. All of these Pokémon are fairly powerful and difficult to find in the wild.

So, which is the rarest Pokémon in the Celdon Casino? It's hard to say for certain, but Mewtwo may just take the title. With its high stats and difficulty in capture, it's no wonder this Pokémon is so sought after by collectors.

#  What are the odds of getting a Shiny Pokémon in the Celdon Casino?

There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on a number of factors, such as the types of Pokémon that are being hunted and the rarity of Shiny Pokémon within that species. However, using data from previous hunts, we can make some estimates about the odds of encountering a Shiny Pokémon in the Celdon Casino.

According to [this study](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/7xw2or/ shiny_pokemon_odds_in_the_celdon_casino/), the Shiny rate for most Pokémon is approximately 1 in 1024. This means that if you were to hunt 10,000 Rattatas, for example, you would expect approximately 10 Shiny ones to appear. The same principle applies when hunting in the Celdon Casino - the more common a species of Pokémon is, the more likely you are to encounter a Shiny one.

That said, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, the Shiny rate for Magikarp is estimated to be 1 in 4004, which is much higher than for most other species. This is because Magikarp are notoriously common and therefore have a higher chance of spawning as a Shiny variant. On the other hand, the Shiny rate for Legendary Pokémon is estimated to be just 1 in 4096, so your chances of encountering one are considerably lower.

Ultimately, there is no guaranteed way to get a Shiny Pokémon in the Celdon Casino - it all comes down to luck. However, by using the information above as a guide, you can improve your chances of encountering one!

#  Which Pokémon can you get from the Celdon Casino without spending any coins?

There are a few different Pokémon that you can get from the Celdon Casino without spending any coins. The most common of these is Pichu, but there are also a few other rare Pokémon that can be obtained in this way.

Pichu is the easiest of all the Pokémon to get without spending any coins. All you have to do is go to the casino and enter it, and then Pichu will start spawning next to you. There’s no need to do anything else – just keep waiting until it spawns.

Other than Pichu, there are a few other rarer Pokémon that can be obtained from the Celdon Casino for free. These include: Magby, Elekid, Smoochum, Togepi, Mareep, and Wooper. However, the chances of obtaining these Pokémon are much lower than getting Pichu, so you may have to try a few times before you finally succeed.

#  How to get a guaranteed Shiny Pokémon from the Celdon Casino!

Did you know that the Celdon Casino offers a chance to get a Shiny Pokémon? It's true! All you have to do is purchase 10,000 tickets from the casino and you will be guaranteed to receive a Shiny Pokémon!
