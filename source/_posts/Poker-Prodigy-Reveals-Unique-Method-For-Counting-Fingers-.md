#  Poker Prodigy Reveals Unique Method For Counting Fingers 

Poker prodigy and world-renowned mathematician Tony DeMarco has developed a unique method for counting the fingers on one's hand.

"I've been working on this for years," said DeMarco. "It all started when I was playing poker and needed to quickly calculate how many fingers my opponents had."

To demonstrate his method, DeMarco counted the fingers on his right hand. "There are six of them," he said. "Plus one thumb, for a total of seven."

DeMarco explained that the method is not just limited to counting fingers. "You can use it to count any objects, no matter how big or small," he said. "I've even used it to count the number of stars in the sky."

The math prodigy says he's happy to share his discovery with the world. "I want to help as many people as I can," he said. "This knowledge can be used in everyday life, from counting out change at the store to figuring out how many cookies you have left in the jar."

When asked if there was anything else he wanted to share, DeMarco had one final piece of advice: "Always use your strongest hand to count fingers."

#  Poker Expert Explains How Different Fingers Affect Gameplay 

Most novice poker players might think that all fingers are created equal, but as any experienced player knows, that is not the case. Each finger can have a different impact on the game, depending on what hand you are playing and your opponent's position.

Here is a guide to the five fingers and how they can help or hurt your gameplay:

The thumb: The thumb is the strongest finger and is great for dominating the table. If you are in late position and have a strong hand, using your thumb to push all in can be very powerful.

The index finger: The index finger is the weakest finger and should generally only be used when you have a very strong hand. When bluffing, it is important to keep your index finger pointed down so that it doesn't give away any information about your cards.

The middle finger: The middle finger is a great all-around finger, and can be used for most situations. It is strong enough to control the table but not so strong that it tips off your opponents.

The ring finger: The ring finger is also a good all-around finger, but it is best used when holding medium strength hands. In particular, it can be helpful when trying to trap an opponent who has already made a bet.

The pinky finger: The pinky finger should generally be avoided, as it is the weakest of all the fingers. However, there are some rare occasions where using the pinky can be helpful, such as when you have a weak hand but want to call a large bet.
