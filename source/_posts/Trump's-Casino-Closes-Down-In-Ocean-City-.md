#  Trump's Casino Closes Down In Ocean City 

The Trump Taj Mahal casino in Ocean City, NJ has closed down after failing to reach a contract agreement with workers. The casino is one of several that have closed in the past year, as Atlantic City continues to struggle economically.

The closure of the Trump Taj Mahal will mean the loss of over 3000 jobs in the region. It is yet another blow to the local economy, which has been struggling for years.

Atlantic City has been hit hard by regional competition from casinos in neighboring states, as well as a decline in tourism. In recent years, the city has seen a string of casino closures, including several that were owned by Donald Trump.

Casinos have long been a staple of the Atlantic City economy, but they are no longer enough to sustain it. The city is now looking for other ways to revive its fortunes, including developing new attractions and increasing tourism.

#  Trump's Casino Fails To Draw Customers In Ocean City 

The new Trump casino in Ocean City, Maryland, is a flop.

Despite its prime location on the Boardwalk, the casino has failed to draw in customers, leaving many of its slot machines and gaming tables unused.

"It just feels kind of sad," said one local resident. "I remember when this place was always packed, but now you can walk right in and the only people you'll see are the employees."

Trump's team had high hopes for the casino, which they said would create jobs and bring much-needed revenue to the area. But it seems that Trump's tarnished reputation has followed him to Maryland, as locals are choosing other casinos instead.

"I'm not surprised," said another resident. "Trump has a history of screwing people over. Why would we want him here?"

#  Trump Casinoshutting Down Doors in Ocean City 

In May, President Donald Trump's business empire drew another legal battle when it tried to shutter a casino in Ocean City, Maryland. Documents obtained by the Associated Press show Trump's company filed for trademark protection of the phrase "Trump Ocean Club" in 2007. The company renewed the trademark application in 2016, several months before the casino's owner—local developer Ryda Corporation—filed paperwork to renew its gaming license.

The Trump Organization then sent a letter to Ryda Corporation in February 2017 telling them to stop using the name. Ryda Corporation argued that it had been using the name since 2011, long before Trump became president. Trump attorney Alan Garten said the company is just trying to protect its intellectual property and that they never intended to force Ryda Corporation out of business.

Despite these reassurances, many residents of Ocean City are worried about the impact the closure could have on the local economy. The casino employs around 500 people and provides an important source of revenue for local businesses. Some are also concerned that this could be a sign of things to come now that Trump is in office. Many fear that he will use his power to try and shut down other businesses that he doesn't own or control.

This isn't the first time Trump has been involved in a conflict with a local business owner. In March, he sued Palm Beach hotel owners who refused to evict their tenant so that Trump could expand his golf course. He has also made several attempts to block construction of a wind farm near one of his golf courses in Scotland.

These cases are just a small sample of the many ways Trump is using his power as president to benefit his businesses empire. This blatant conflicts of interest is causing concern among many Americans who worry that he is using his position for personal gain.

#  Casino Trump Leaving Town in Ocean City 

It was announced this week that the Casino Trump in Ocean City will be closing its doors for good at the end of October. This comes as a surprise to many, as the casino has been a mainstay in the town for over two decades.

The casino is blaming the closure on increased competition from casinos in nearby states, such as Delaware and Pennsylvania. It's no secret that those states have seen an increase in tourism in recent years, as gambling has become more widely available.

For Ocean City residents and business owners, the closure of Casino Trump is a major blow. The casino has been responsible for generating millions of dollars in tax revenue for the town over the years. It's also been a major employer, with over 300 people currently working at the casino.

There is some hope that another business will take over the space vacated by Casino Trump, but it's unclear what that might be. In the meantime, there are concerns about what this will mean for Ocean City's economy.

Many people are sad to see Casino Trump go, but it's clear that the winds of change are blowing in the gaming industry. It will be interesting to see how things play out in the coming months and years.

#  Trump's Casino Folds Up in the Face of Competition in Ocean City

In an ironic turn of events, the Trump casino in Ocean City, New Jersey has gone bankrupt, just as a new casino owned by Phil Ruffin opens up across the street.

The Trump casino, which opened in 1985, was one of the first in the area. However, it has been struggling in recent years due to increased competition from other casinos in the area.

Ruffin's new casino, the Ocean Resort Casino, opened on June 28th and has been doing very well so far. It is estimated that it will bring in $25 million in its first year.

Trump's casino filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Tuesday. The company plans to restructure its debt and continue operating.

Trump's casino is not the only one to have gone bankrupt in recent years. Other casinos in Atlantic City have also closed down due to competition from neighboring states.
