#  How to make a bingo card in Word 2010

Making a bingo card in Microsoft Word 2010 is an easy process that can be completed in a few simple steps. To get started, open a new document in Word and then select the “Bing Maps” tab under the “Insert” tab.

Once the Bing Maps tab is selected, you will be able to choose between a variety of different map layouts. For a bingo card, you will want to select the “Grid” layout. This will create a grid of squares that can be used for your bingo card.

After selecting the Grid layout, you will need to specify how many rows and columns you want your card to have. For a traditional bingo card, you will want 5 rows and 5 columns. However, you can choose any number of rows and columns depending on your needs.

Once you have set the number of rows and columns, you can then begin to populate your card with numbers or text. To add numbers, simply type them into the squares on the grid. You can also use the Bing Maps tab to insert specific addresses or locations into your card.

Alternatively, if you want to use text instead of numbers, you can type it into the squares on the grid. You can also use special characters like asterisks or hyphens to create patterns in your text.

When you are finished adding numbers or text to your card, you can then print it out or save it as a PDF file.

#  How to make a bingo card in Word 2013

To make a bingo card in Microsoft Word 2013, you will first need to open a new document. From the ribbon at the top of the window, select “Page Layout” and then “Breaks”. In the drop-down menu, choose “Next Page”. This will create two pages in your document – the first will be for the grid of numbers and the second will be for the letters.

Now you can start creating the grid for your bingo card. Type “1” in the top left corner of page 1 and then press return to create a new line. Type “2” directly below it, followed by three more lines with the numbers 3, 4, and 5. To create a line break between each number, press enter twice after each number.

Now you can start adding in the letters. Type A in cell 2A, B in cell 2B, and so on until you reach Z in cell 26Z. Again, press enter twice after each letter to create a line break.

When you are finished, save your document as a PDF file. Now you can print it out and use it for your next game of bingo!

#  How to make a bingo card in Word 2016

Making a bingo card in Word 2016 is a quick and easy process. You can create one with or without images, and even personalize it with your own words or phrases.

To make a basic bingo card, open a new Word document and click on the "Layout" tab. In the "Page Setup" section, click on the "Orientation" drop-down menu and select "Portrait."

Then, click on the "Insert" tab and select the "Table" option. Drag and drop a table onto your document, then enter the number of rows and columns you want it to have.

Next, fill in each square in the table with a random number or letter. You can also add images or text to each square if you like.

To create a bingo card with phrases instead of numbers, type your phrases into one column of the table, then duplicate that column so you have two identical columns. In the second column, type in numbers 1-25 (or any other sequence). This will create a bingo card where players have to match up phrases with numbers.

When you're done formatting your card, save it as a PDF file so that it can be printed out later.
