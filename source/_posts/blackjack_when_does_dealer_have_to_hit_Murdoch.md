# Blackjack: When Does the Dealer Have to Hit? Explained by Murdoch

Blackjack is a popular casino game that requires both skill and luck. It's a game where the dealer plays a crucial role, and one of the most critical aspects of the dealer's role is knowing when to hit. In this article, we will explain when the dealer has to hit in blackjack, as explained by Murdoch.

## The Rules of Blackjack

Before we dive into when the dealer has to hit, let's review the rules of blackjack. In blackjack, the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. Each player is dealt two cards, and they have the option to "hit" and receive additional cards or "stand" and keep their current hand. The dealer also receives two cards, but one card is face down.

The value of the cards in blackjack is as follows:

- Ace: 1 or 11
- 2-10: face value
- Jack, Queen, King: 10

If a player's hand exceeds 21, they lose the game. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, the player wins the game. If both the player and dealer have hands that are less than or equal to 21, the one with the highest hand value wins.

## When Does the Dealer Have to Hit?

In blackjack, the dealer must follow a specific set of rules when it comes to hitting. These rules are determined by the casino and are usually displayed on the table.

Generally speaking, the dealer must hit if their hand is less than 17. If the dealer's hand is 17 or more, they must stand. This rule is known as the "dealer must hit soft 17" rule.

A soft hand is a hand that contains an Ace that is being counted as 11. For example, a hand of Ace and 6 would be a soft 17 because the Ace is being counted as 11. In this case, the dealer would hit.

If the dealer has a hard hand, which is a hand that does not contain an Ace or an Ace that is being counted as 1, the dealer must hit if their hand is less than 17 and stand if their hand is 17 or more.

## Why Does the Dealer Have to Follow These Rules?

The reason the dealer must follow these rules is to ensure that the game is fair and unbiased. By following these rules, the dealer cannot make decisions based on their own personal preferences, which would give them an unfair advantage over the players.

Additionally, these rules ensure that the game moves quickly and efficiently. If the dealer were allowed to make their own decisions about hitting and standing, the game could become slow and tedious, which would discourage players from playing.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the dealer plays an essential role in blackjack, and knowing when to hit is crucial. The dealer must follow specific rules regarding hitting and standing to ensure that the game is fair and unbiased. By understanding these rules, players can develop a winning strategy and increase their chances of winning at blackjack.
